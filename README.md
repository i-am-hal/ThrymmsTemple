# Thrymm's Temple
This is a rogue-like, a sequel to Downward Descent (another rogue-like which I made).
In this I wanted to make some improvements, and some additions and changes to what I
had in Downward Descent. Now, one question may be "why exactly make another rogue like
that is almost the same as Downward Descent?" Well, I frankly really enjoyed making
Downward Descent, and I have been having just as much fun making Thrymm's Temple.

If you would like to play the game, feel free to download the source and build
it directly from the source code (located in the src folder).
